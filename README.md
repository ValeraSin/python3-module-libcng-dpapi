# Bindings for LIBCNG-DPAPI

An alternative Python library for DPAPI NG (CNG DPAPI) encryption and decription, replicating the behavior of Windows NCryptUnprotectSecret and NCryptProtectSecret. 
This solution enables cross-platform decryption of DPAPI NG-protected secrets on non-Windows systems, including PFX user-protected passwords and LAPS encrypted credentials.
